# Authentication

## CLI bootstrap and release lookup

CLI bootstrap/update metadata recovery is separate from package authentication. See [Public release metadata](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/getting-started/installation/#public-release-metadata) for token precedence and bounded anonymous retry, and [mirror migration](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/getting-started/installation/#enterprise-bootstrap-mirror-mode) for final-endpoint configuration.

## Token precedence chain

For public `github.com` HTTPS repositories, APM makes one anonymous attempt before checking any token source. The attempt removes GitHub token variables, credential-bearing HTTP headers, and credential helpers while preserving CA settings, safe URL rewrites, non-credential HTTP headers, and `credential.interactive=never`.

Only HTTP 401, 403, 404, or an equivalent Git authentication failure unlocks the fallback chain below. DNS, TLS, timeout, and GitHub throttle failures do not prompt for credentials. Ordinary credentials are cached per `(host, port, org)` for the process. A private `github.com` helper fallback adds the repository path to that scope, so later phases reuse it without applying that credential to another repository. APM never writes the credential into persistent cache keys or stored remote URLs.

Managed GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps credentials use process-scoped
Authorization headers. They are never embedded in Git URL userinfo.

Before each dependency Git operation that uses a remote URL, APM checks the
longest matching rewrite. It rejects rewrites that embed credentials, switch to
insecure transports such as `http://` or `git://`, use remote-helper syntax
such as `ext::` or `https::`, or send a network remote to a different host. A
managed HTTPS credential cannot cross a scheme, host, or port boundary.
Same-host SSH rewrites and local mirrors remain credential-free.

If a rewrite is rejected and it should be safe, inspect the effective Git
config and matching `insteadOf` rules, then retry:

```bash
git config --show-origin --get-regexp '^url\..*\.insteadOf$'
```

Remove or replace the rule only if it is unsafe or misconfigured.

If the selected rewrite is a `file://` mirror and the clone fails, verify that
the local path exists and is readable. Fix or remove that rewrite; host
credentials cannot repair a missing local mirror.

APM snapshots the effective Git config, validates the longest matching rewrite,
and passes that fixed result to the child Git process. It drops malformed
ambient HTTP headers before it applies either an anonymous empty-header fence or
one path-scoped AuthResolver header. For effective URLs outside HTTP(S), APM
skips the `http.extraHeader` URL-match probe. Dependency clones ignore Git
templates and checkout hooks.

When fallback is required, APM checks these sources in order:

| Priority | Variable | Scope | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | `GITHUB_APM_PAT_{ORG}` | Per-org | Org name uppercased, hyphens to underscores |
| 2 | `GITHUB_APM_PAT` | Global | Falls back to git credential if rejected |
| 3 | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Global | Shared with GitHub Actions |
| 4 | `GH_TOKEN` | Global | Set by `gh auth login` |
| 5 | `gh auth token --hostname <host>` | GitHub-like hosts | Active `gh auth login` account |
| 6 | `git credential fill` | Per-host | System credential manager. APM forwards `path=<owner>/<repo>` so Git Credential Manager users with `credential.useHttpPath = true` get per-URL account selection (no account-picker prompt). |
| -- | None | -- | No credential was available after an auth-shaped anonymous failure |

APM checks the active `gh` CLI account before invoking OS credential helpers. This reduces ambiguous multi-account prompts on hosts like github.com. If the `gh` CLI is not installed or no account is active, APM skips this step silently and continues to `git credential fill`.

This anonymous-first rule applies only to `github.com` HTTPS. GHE Cloud, GHES, ADO,
GitLab, SSH, local paths, and generic hosts keep their existing authentication
and transport behavior.

For multi-account Git Credential Manager setups, see the [Multi-account Git Credential Manager](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/getting-started/authentication/#multi-account-git-credential-manager) section in the main authentication guide.

## SSH clone prerequisites

APM runs git clones non-interactively. Before using an SSH dependency, make
sure its key is already available to SSH. Unlock a passphrase-protected key
first (for example, with `ssh-add <key-file>`). In CI, load a dedicated deploy
key non-interactively or use token-backed HTTPS.

APM uses the selected transport for clone/fetch and semver tag discovery. When
`prefer-ssh` selects SSH, strict mode does not silently probe HTTPS.

## Marketplace transport

For in-repository plugins from GitLab and generic git marketplaces, an SSH
registration stays SSH when APM generates the concrete `git:` and `path:`
dependency. Existing SSH keys keep working instead of the dependency being
rewritten to HTTPS.

Generic marketplace HTTPS sources may use the native Git credential helper from
your Git configuration. Generic HTTP fetches suppress credential channels, HTTPS-
to-HTTP rewrites are rejected, and generic SSH stays token-free. See the
[full transport policy](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/getting-started/authentication/#generic-marketplace-git-transport).

## GitLab hosts

`gitlab.com` is detected automatically. For self-managed GitLab, set
`GITLAB_HOST`, list multiple hosts in `APM_GITLAB_HOSTS`, or mark a single
object-form dependency with `type: gitlab`:

```yaml
- git: https://code.acme.com/platform/standards.git
  type: gitlab
```

`GITLAB_APM_PAT` and `GITLAB_TOKEN` apply only to `gitlab.com` and hosts trusted
through `GITLAB_HOST` or `APM_GITLAB_HOSTS`. `type: gitlab` selects backend/API
routing only; other hinted hosts use host-scoped `git credential fill` or
public access and do not receive global GitLab tokens. GitHub PAT variables are
not used for GitLab-class hosts.
See the main [authentication guide](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/getting-started/authentication/)
for the full host-class precedence rules.

## Per-org setup

Use per-org tokens when accessing packages across multiple organizations:

```bash
export GITHUB_APM_PAT_CONTOSO=ghp_token_for_contoso
export GITHUB_APM_PAT_FABRIKAM=ghp_token_for_fabrikam
```

**Naming rules:**
- Uppercase the org name
- Replace hyphens with underscores
- Example: `contoso-microsoft` -> `GITHUB_APM_PAT_CONTOSO_MICROSOFT`

## Fine-grained PAT requirements

Required permissions:
- **Metadata:** Read
- **Contents:** Read
- **Repository access:** All repos or specific repos

**Important:** The resource owner must be the **organization**, not your user
account. User-scoped fine-grained PATs cannot access org repos even if you are
a member.

For SSO-protected orgs, authorize the token under Settings > Tokens > Configure SSO.

## Azure DevOps (ADO)

Azure DevOps Services supports two auth modes; the GitHub token chain does
not apply. The recommended approach is `az login`; explicit PATs are also
supported. Resolution order:

1. `ADO_APM_PAT` env var if set
2. AAD bearer from `az account get-access-token` if `az` is installed and signed in
3. Otherwise: auth-failed error with actionable diagnostic

```bash
# Recommended: bearer mode (no env var needed)
az login --tenant <tenant-id>
apm install dev.azure.com/org/project/_git/repo

# Alternative: PAT mode
export ADO_APM_PAT=your_ado_pat
apm install dev.azure.com/org/project/_git/repo
```

ADO paths use the 3-segment format: `org/project/repo`. Auth is always required.
No ADO Git path invokes native credential helpers.
`apm marketplace check` uses the PAT-to-bearer chain. See
[Marketplace source bases](package-authoring.md#marketplace-source-bases) for
ADO marketplace URL authoring.

**Finding your tenant ID:** visit `https://dev.azure.com/{org}/_settings/organizationAad`,
or run `az login` and inspect `az account show --query tenantId -o tsv`.

If `ADO_APM_PAT` is set but ADO returns 401, APM silently retries with the `az`
bearer for clone, preflight, semver tag, and marketplace ref resolution, then warns:
`[!] ADO_APM_PAT was rejected for {host}; fell back to az cli bearer.`

When auth fails entirely, APM prints a targeted diagnostic (not a generic "not accessible"
message). For `--update` operations, a pre-flight auth check runs before any files are
modified -- on failure you see `No files were modified`.

### On-prem Azure DevOps Server

For self-hosted Azure DevOps Server installations (not Azure DevOps Services at
`dev.azure.com`), tell APM which hostname to treat as ADO:

```bash
# Single server
export ADO_HOST=ado.corp.example.com
export ADO_APM_PAT=your_ado_pat
apm install ado.corp.example.com/DefaultCollection/project/_git/repo

# Explicit HTTPS port belongs in the dependency URL, not ADO_HOST
apm install https://ado.corp.example.com:8443/DefaultCollection/project/_git/repo

# Multiple servers
export APM_ADO_HOSTS=ado1.corp.example.com,ado2.corp.example.com
```

`ADO_HOST` registers a single on-prem host; `APM_ADO_HOSTS` accepts a
comma-separated list for environments with multiple ADO Server instances.
Values are hostnames only (no scheme, port, or path), trimmed, matched
case-insensitively, and must be valid FQDNs. Explicit HTTPS ports belong in
the dependency URL. The first path segment is the server collection.
Root-hosted collection URLs are supported; `/tfs/` or another server
base-path prefix is not currently supported.

Azure DevOps Server authentication is PAT-only in APM. Set `ADO_APM_PAT`;
the Azure CLI bearer fallback applies to Azure DevOps Services, not Server.

`GITHUB_HOST` alone classifies a custom hostname as GitHub Enterprise Server.
When `ADO_HOST` or `APM_ADO_HOSTS` also names that host, the ADO
configuration takes precedence and excludes GitHub credentials. You do not
need to unset `GITHUB_HOST`.

### ADO auth troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `No ADO_APM_PAT was set and az CLI is not installed` | Neither path available | Install `az` from https://aka.ms/installazurecli and run `az login --tenant <tenant>`, or set `ADO_APM_PAT` |
| `az CLI is installed but no active session was found` | `az account show` fails | Run `az login --tenant <tenant>` against the tenant that owns the org |
| `az CLI returned a token but the org does not accept it (likely a tenant mismatch)` | Wrong tenant | Run `az login --tenant <correct-tenant>`, or set `ADO_APM_PAT` |
| `ADO_APM_PAT was rejected (HTTP 401) and no az cli fallback was available` | Stale PAT, no `az` | Rotate the PAT, or install `az` and run `az login --tenant <tenant>` |
| On-prem host classified as GHES / GitHub credentials selected | `GITHUB_HOST` set without an ADO host configuration | Add `ADO_HOST=your-ado-server.example.com` (or list it in `APM_ADO_HOSTS`); ADO takes precedence |

## GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES)

```bash
export GITHUB_HOST=github.company.com
export GITHUB_APM_PAT_MYORG=ghp_ghes_token
apm install myorg/internal-package       # resolves to github.company.com
apm pack                                 # marketplace.json also resolves against github.company.com
```

## GitLab (SaaS or self-managed)

GitLab `path:` single-file sparse fetches follow the clone transport policy:
`--ssh`, `APM_GIT_PROTOCOL`, saved `prefer-ssh`, and opt-in
`--allow-protocol-fallback` / `APM_ALLOW_PROTOCOL_FALLBACK`. In strict mode,
APM passes the selected SSH/SCP URL to Git with its user, host, port, and
requested ref intact; safe Git `insteadOf` rewrites still apply. If the
effective transport remains SSH, failure never unlocks REST, even with a
PAT available. Fix SSH or declare the HTTPS web endpoint.

Default HTTPS compatibility remains. REST requires an exhausted Git plan
and an executed effective HTTPS attempt matching the API's normalized
scheme/host/port. HTTP is not upgraded; HTTPS rewritten to SSH/local does
not qualify. Opt-in alternate protocol reuses the declared custom port and
warns, without mapping SSH aliases to web hostnames. See the
[GitLab fetch policy](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/consumer/authentication/#gitlab-saas-or-self-managed)
and [GitLab hosts](#gitlab-hosts) for token trust.

## GHE Cloud data residency (*.ghe.com)

```bash
export GITHUB_APM_PAT_MYENTERPRISE=ghp_enterprise_token
apm install myenterprise.ghe.com/platform/standards
```

No public repos exist on `*.ghe.com` -- auth is always required.

## Enterprise Managed Users (EMU)

- EMU orgs live on `github.com` (e.g., `contoso-microsoft`) or `*.ghe.com`
- Use standard PAT prefixes (`ghp_`, `github_pat_`)
- Fine-grained PATs must use the EMU org as resource owner
- EMU accounts cannot access public repos on github.com
- If mixing enterprise and public repos, use separate tokens

## Artifactory proxy (air-gapped environments)

```bash
export PROXY_REGISTRY_URL=https://artifactory.company.com/apm-remote
export PROXY_REGISTRY_TOKEN=your_bearer_token
export PROXY_REGISTRY_ONLY=1                   # optional: proxy-only mode
```

When `PROXY_REGISTRY_ONLY=1`, APM routes all traffic through the proxy and
never contacts GitHub directly.

## Registry tokens (experimental)

REST-based APM registries (behind `apm experimental enable registries`) use
a **separate** credential chain from the GitHub / ADO token chains above.
Tokens are scoped per registry name as declared in `apm.yml`'s `registries:`
block (or in `~/.apm/config.json`).

Credentials are released only when `registry.<name>.url` in
`~/.apm/config.json` matches the request destination. Configure this
user-owned URL even when a project declares the same registry. Project-only
registry declarations are anonymous, and credentials are never sent over
HTTP.

**Env-var naming:** `APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_{NAME}` where `{NAME}` is the
registry name uppercased, with `-` and `.` mapped to `_`.

| Registry name | Env var |
|---------------|---------|
| `jf-skills` | `APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_JF_SKILLS` |
| `corp-main` | `APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_CORP_MAIN` |
| `corp.snapshots` | `APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_CORP_SNAPSHOTS` |

**Auth modes:**

| Env var(s) | Sent as |
|------------|---------|
| `APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_{NAME}` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |
| `APM_REGISTRY_USER_{NAME}` + `APM_REGISTRY_PASS_{NAME}` | `Authorization: Basic <base64(user:pass)>` |

Bearer wins when both forms are set.

**Token precedence (per registry, highest wins):**

1. `APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_{NAME}` (or `APM_REGISTRY_USER_{NAME}` + `APM_REGISTRY_PASS_{NAME}`) env var
2. `registry.<name>.token` in `~/.apm/config.json` (via `apm config set`)
3. Unauthenticated -- APM sends the request anonymously first; remediation
   pointing at `APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_<NAME>` is printed only on `401`/`403`

```bash
# Bearer token for registry "jf-skills"
apm config set registry.jf-skills.url https://registry.example.com
export APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_JF_SKILLS=eyJ...

# Or HTTP Basic
export APM_REGISTRY_USER_JF_SKILLS=alice@example.com
export APM_REGISTRY_PASS_JF_SKILLS=secret

# Or stored in user config (never committed)
apm config set registry.jf-skills.token eyJ...
```

**Relationship to other chains:** `APM_REGISTRY_*` is a distinct prefix
from `GITHUB_APM_PAT_*`, `ADO_APM_PAT`, `PROXY_REGISTRY_*`, and
`ARTIFACTORY_APM_TOKEN`. There is no collision: registry-routed deps go
through the registry chain only; Git-routed deps continue through the
GitHub / ADO chains above. A single project with both registry and Git
deps uses both chains side-by-side.

**Sanitization trap:** distinct registry names can collapse to the same
env var (`corp-main`, `corp.main`, `Corp-Main` all sanitize to
`APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_CORP_MAIN`). Do not declare two registries whose
names sanitize identically. Prefer hyphenated lowercase names.

Tokens MUST NOT appear in repo YAML. In `apm.yml`, a `token:` field
under a `registries:` entry is rejected at parse time (token trap). In
`apm-policy.yml`, a top-level `token:` key is not a recognized policy
field and surfaces as an "Unknown top-level policy key" warning rather
than a hard parse error -- but storing tokens there is still
unsupported and committing one would leak the secret into the repo.
Store tokens in env vars or `~/.apm/config.json` only.

## External scanner LLM keys (experimental)

When LLM-powered analysis is enabled for an external SARIF scanner (`apm
audit --external <name> --external-llm`, behind `apm experimental enable
external-scanners`), the scanner reads its own API key from your
environment -- `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `NVIDIA_INFERENCE_KEY`. APM **never
stores, prompts for, or persists** these keys; they come straight from
your shell environment and are forwarded to the scanner subprocess only
when LLM mode is active for that run, then stripped otherwise. If
`--external-llm` is set and no key is present, the scan fails closed with
an actionable error. Scanner stderr is secret-redacted before APM surfaces
it in any error or log. Do not pass keys as scanner flags (`--external-args`
rejects secret-looking flags) -- export them as env vars instead.

## Install validation chain

`apm install <package>` validates a virtual subdirectory package (`owner/repo/path#ref`) before writing it to `apm.yml`. The chain mirrors the actual clone auth path so a credential that succeeds for `git clone` is never false-rejected by the installer:

1. **Marker-file probes** via raw content -- `apm.yml`, `SKILL.md`, `plugin.json`, `README.md`. Fast positive signal; absence is not a failure.
2. **Contents API directory probe** -- `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}?ref={ref}`. Confirms the directory exists at the ref.
3. **`git ls-remote`** with the install auth chain (PAT header-injected, then plain HTTPS w/ credential helper, then SSH if `--ssh` or `--allow-protocol-fallback`). Confirms the ref exists.
4. **Shallow `git fetch --depth=1 --filter=tree:0` + `git ls-tree`** at the resolved ref -- the path probe that confirms the subdirectory exists at that ref. Required to close the fail-open hole where step 3 would otherwise pass any successful repo handshake.

Steps 3 and 4 only run for explicit `#ref` pins (not for unpinned default-branch deps), and only when the API steps fail. Azure DevOps tokens (PAT or AAD bearer) are injected via `http.extraheader` (`Authorization: Bearer ...`) and never embedded in the clone URL.

**Yellow signal:** when steps 1-2 fail and steps 3-4 succeed, APM emits a stderr warning -- `[!] API validation skipped for {pkg}; resolved via git credential fallback.` This is security-relevant: a scoped fine-grained PAT may have *correctly* rejected a package on the API surface and the broader git credential chain accepted it. Operators should be able to see that signal in default CI logs.

**Terminal error** when all four steps fail: `[x] all probes failed (marker-file, Contents API, git ls-remote, shallow-fetch) -- verify the path and ref exist and that your credentials have read access (run with --verbose for the full probe log)`.

```bash
# See the full probe log when validation fails
apm install --verbose owner/repo/path#v1.2.0
```

## Troubleshooting

```bash
# Diagnose the auth chain -- shows which token source is used
apm install --verbose your-org/package

# Increase git credential timeout (default 60s, max 180s)
export APM_GIT_CREDENTIAL_TIMEOUT=120
```

### Custom-port hosts and per-port credentials

Self-hosted Git instances on non-standard ports (e.g. Bitbucket Datacenter
on port 7999) are now first-class. APM sends `host=<host>:<port>` to
`git credential fill` per the [`gitcredentials(7)`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials)
protocol; the credential cache and token resolution are also keyed by
`(host, port)` so distinct PATs on the same hostname do not collide.

Whether the helper actually returns per-port credentials depends on the
backend:

| Helper | Honors port-in-host? |
|---|---|
| git-credential-manager (GCM) | Yes |
| macOS Keychain (`osxkeychain`) | Yes (stores full `host:port` as key) |
| `libsecret` (Linux) | Yes (port in URI) |
| `gh auth git-credential` | No -- but only used for GitHub hosts, which do not use custom ports |

To verify what your helper returns for a custom-port host, use the
helper-agnostic command APM itself calls:

```sh
printf 'protocol=https\nhost=<host>:<port>\n\n' | git credential fill
```

If APM resolves the wrong credential for a custom-port host, confirm your
helper keys by `host:port`; otherwise either switch helpers or store the
credential under a fully qualified `https://<host>:<port>/` URL.

### SSH connection hangs on corporate/VPN networks

APM tries SSH when selected or cross-protocol fallback is enabled. It forces
`BatchMode=yes`, disables askpass and HTTP credential channels, and uses a
30-second connection timeout so SSH attempts fail without prompting.

To override the SSH command (e.g., custom key path), set `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`
in your environment. APM forces `BatchMode=yes` and appends
`-o ConnectTimeout=30` unless it finds `ConnectTimeout` already present.
