# Installation

## macOS with Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install apm
```

No custom tap is required. Homebrew owns installation and updates in its
managed environment; it does not eliminate supply-chain risk.

## Linux / macOS without Homebrew

Homebrew is optional. Use the standalone installer or pip below.

```bash
curl -sSL https://aka.ms/apm-unix | sh
```

## Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://aka.ms/apm-windows | iex
```

Fresh ordinary-user Unix native installs use `~/.local/bin/apm` and `~/.local/lib/apm`, without `sudo`. For bash, zsh, and fish, the installer automatically configures future shells when the install path and profile files are safe. Open a new shell after install. If the installer skips profile edits, follow the manual `PATH` command it prints: POSIX shells use `export PATH=...`; fish uses `set -gx PATH ...`.

## Package managers

```bash
# Homebrew (macOS / Linux)
brew install apm
```

WinGet requires [WinGet / App Installer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#install-winget) on Windows 10 version 1809 or later.

```powershell
# WinGet (Windows)
winget install --id Microsoft.APM --exact --source winget
```

```powershell
# Scoop (Windows)
scoop bucket add apm https://github.com/microsoft/scoop-apm
scoop install apm
```

```bash
# pip (all platforms, requires Python 3.10+)
python3 -m pip install apm-cli
```

## Verify

```bash
apm --version
```

## Update

Use the same tool that installed APM:

| Installation | Update command |
|--------------|----------------|
| Homebrew core | `brew upgrade apm` |
| pip | `pip install --upgrade apm-cli` |
| WinGet | `winget upgrade --id Microsoft.APM --exact --source winget` |
| Scoop | `scoop update apm` |
| Standalone installer | `apm self-update` |

Homebrew core disables `apm self-update` and its startup update notification.
Do not run the standalone installer over a package-manager-owned installation.
For an existing `microsoft/apm` tap installation, follow the
[tap-to-core migration guide](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/getting-started/installation/#migrate-from-the-microsoft-tap).

For standalone installs only:

```bash
apm self-update          # update APM itself
apm self-update --check  # check for updates without installing
```

## Installer options (macOS / Linux)

```bash
# Specific version
curl -sSL https://aka.ms/apm-unix | sh -s -- @v1.2.3

# Prefix root for a fresh install (launcher: $HOME/.local/bin, bundle: $HOME/.local/lib/apm)
curl -sSL https://aka.ms/apm-unix | sh -s -- --prefix "$HOME/.local"

# Custom fresh install (bundle: $HOME/tools/lib/apm)
curl -sSL https://aka.ms/apm-unix | APM_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/tools/bin" sh

# Opt out of automatic shell PATH setup
curl -sSL https://aka.ms/apm-unix | APM_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1 sh

# Re-enable after opting out
curl -sSL https://aka.ms/apm-unix | APM_NO_MODIFY_PATH=0 sh

# GHES release host (not a generic air-gap mirror). VERSION skips
# releases/latest; private checksum retries can still query the exact tag.
GITHUB_URL=https://github.corp.com VERSION=v1.2.3 sh install.sh
```

Unix binary installs require publisher `.sha256` sidecars, with no integrity-failure pip fallback or bypass. For true bootstrap mirrors, use the [enterprise mirror recipe](https://github.com/microsoft/apm/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/getting-started/installation.md#enterprise-bootstrap-mirror-mode): sync the updated `install.sh` plus each original archive and matching `.sha256` sidecar together. See [archive verification](https://github.com/microsoft/apm/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/getting-started/installation.md#unix-archive-verification) for requirements and [self-update](https://github.com/microsoft/apm/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/reference/cli/self-update.md#enterprise-bootstrap-mirrors) for the release-tag installer caveat.

### Unix ownership and migration

`install.sh` preserves recognized installations and refuses shadow installs, package-managed or unrecognized launchers, foreign-owned bundles, unsafe destinations, and destination changes.

Inspect unrecognized data without deleting it. For a fresh install, choose another empty dedicated bundle; otherwise use the original owner's uninstall process.

Update or uninstall pip-owned installs with the owning Python's `-m pip`; uninstall before switching to the binary installer. Automatic pip fallback requires a fresh ordinary-user install with neither destination variable set and uses the selected `python3 -m pip` or `python -m pip`. It prints a PATH command or, when one directory cannot be represented safely, an absolute launcher command. Pip fallback never edits profiles or writes native shell setup policy.

`--prefix PATH` is an explicit Unix destination selector. It derives `PATH/bin` and `PATH/lib/apm`, counts as both destinations for root, and refuses contradictory `APM_INSTALL_DIR` or `APM_LIB_DIR` values before downloads or writes.

Root requires both `APM_INSTALL_DIR` and `APM_LIB_DIR`, or one `--prefix`; one destination variable refuses the install. See the canonical [Unix ownership and migration procedure](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/getting-started/installation/#unix-install-ownership-and-migration).

## Installer options (Windows PowerShell)

Uses the same variables as `install.sh` where applicable (`GITHUB_URL`, `APM_REPO`, `VERSION`, `APM_INSTALL_DIR`). See the full variable table, Actions example, checksum rules, and canonical Windows `PATH` layout in [installation.md](https://github.com/microsoft/apm/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/getting-started/installation.md).

```powershell
# Pin a version (skips releases/latest API). Requires .sha256 on the release unless APM_SKIP_CHECKSUM=1 (emergency).
$env:VERSION = "v1.2.3"; irm https://aka.ms/apm-windows | iex

# Custom shim directory (contains apm.cmd; sibling current contains apm.exe)
$env:APM_INSTALL_DIR = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Programs\apm\bin"; irm https://aka.ms/apm-windows | iex

$env:GITHUB_URL = "https://github.corp.com"
$env:APM_REPO = "my-org/apm"
$env:VERSION = "v1.2.3"
irm https://aka.ms/apm-windows | iex
```

## Enterprise bootstrap mirrors

Use the variables below to install and update APM through an internal mirror. See the [installation bootstrap mirror section](https://github.com/microsoft/apm/blob/main/docs/src/content/docs/getting-started/installation.md#enterprise-bootstrap-mirror-mode) for fail-closed scope, GHES behavior, and the no-egress smoke test.

```bash
export APM_INSTALLER_BASE_URL="https://artifactory.mycorp.example/generic/apm-install"
export APM_RELEASE_METADATA_URL="https://artifactory.mycorp.example/generic/apm-releases/latest.json"
export APM_RELEASE_BASE_URL="https://artifactory.mycorp.example/generic/apm-releases"
export APM_PYPI_INDEX_URL="https://artifactory.mycorp.example/api/pypi/python-proxy/simple"
export APM_NO_DIRECT_FALLBACK=1
curl -sSL "$APM_INSTALLER_BASE_URL/install.sh" | sh
apm self-update --check
```

For dependency installs after bootstrap, keep using `PROXY_REGISTRY_URL` and `PROXY_REGISTRY_ONLY=1`. Homebrew and Scoop mirroring is package-manager documentation only in v0; these env vars do not rewrite Homebrew or Scoop internals.

Native automatic shell setup writes only installer-owned marked profile blocks that source generated hooks under `~/.apm/shell`. CI/headless/root installs, self-update, unknown shells, unsafe profiles, unsafe paths, and pip fallback do not edit profiles.

## Troubleshooting

- **macOS/Linux "command not found":** for Homebrew, follow `brew shellenv`
  guidance from your Homebrew installation. For standalone native desktop
  installs, open a new shell; if setup was skipped, run the shell-specific
  `PATH` command the installer printed. Pip installs never edit profiles.
- **Permission denied:** use a caller-owned destination, such as
  `--prefix "$HOME/.local"` for a fresh standalone install. The Unix installer
  does not use `sudo`.
- **Windows antivirus locks:** set `$env:APM_DEBUG = "1"` and retry.
