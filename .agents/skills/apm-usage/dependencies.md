# Dependency Reference

## String forms (in apm.yml `dependencies.apm`)

```yaml
dependencies:
  apm:
    # GitHub shorthand
    - microsoft/apm-sample-package
    - microsoft/apm-sample-package#v1.0.0       # pinned tag
    - microsoft/apm-sample-package#main          # branch
    - microsoft/apm-sample-package#abc123d       # commit SHA (7-40 hex)

    # HTTPS URLs (any git host)
    - https://github.com/microsoft/apm-sample-package.git
    - https://gitlab.com/acme/coding-standards.git

    # SSH URLs
    - git@github.com:microsoft/apm-sample-package.git
    - git@gitlab.com:group/subgroup/repo.git

    # SSH with non-default user (EMU accounts, servers where login != "git")
    - myuser@host.example.com:owner/repo.git
    - ssh://myuser@host.example.com/owner/repo.git

    # Custom ports (e.g. Bitbucket Datacenter, self-hosted GitLab)
    - ssh://git@bitbucket.example.com:7999/project/repo.git
    - https://git.internal:8443/team/repo.git

    # Bitbucket Data Center personal repos (~user) and Sourcehut
    - https://bitbucket.example.com/scm/~jdoe/ml-utils.git
    - https://git.sr.ht/~jdoe/dotfiles

    # FQDN shorthand (non-GitHub hosts keep the domain)
    - gitlab.com/acme/coding-standards
    - gitlab.com/group/subgroup/repo

    # Azure DevOps
    - dev.azure.com/org/project/_git/repo

    # Local paths (development only)
    - ./packages/my-shared-skills
    - ../sibling-repo/my-package
```

GitHub and package-registry owner/repository identifiers are normalized to
lowercase only for comparison, lock keys, and cache identity. The first
declaration selects the repository display spelling retained in `apm.yml`,
`apm_modules/`, and generated relative links. Reinstall migrates one stale
APM-created case variant; multiple case-equivalent package directories stop
install for manual inspection. Repository path casing remains
identity-significant for unknown git hosts because a self-hosted backend may be
case-sensitive.

**Local-path anchor rule:** a `local_path` declared INSIDE another local
package is resolved relative to THAT package's own directory (npm/pip/cargo
parity). Sibling layouts that resolve outside the consuming project root
(e.g. `../sibling-pkg` from a local dep at the project edge) are
supported -- the consuming developer authored the manifest chain and
already trusts the layout.

Remote-cloned packages may declare a relative `path:` only when it resolves
inside the same authenticated remote repo root. APM expands that path to the
parent's remote host/repo/ref and fetches the sibling from the same origin.
Absolute paths, paths that escape the repo root, and cross-repo local paths
are rejected.

**GitLab `path:` fetch transport:** GitLab `path:` files use Git first, so
self-hosted instances with the API disabled still install. Restricted REST
fallback requires an exhausted plan with an executed same-origin effective
HTTPS attempt. Path containment rejects symlink or traversal escapes.
See [GitLab authentication and fetch policy](authentication.md#gitlab-saas-or-self-managed).

### Custom git ports

Non-default git ports are preserved on `https://`, `http://`, and `ssh://` URLs
and threaded through every clone attempt (including any cross-protocol
fallback enabled with `--allow-protocol-fallback`).

- Use the `ssh://` form to specify an SSH port
  (e.g. `ssh://git@host:7999/owner/repo.git`). The SCP shorthand
  `git@host:path` **cannot** carry a port -- the `:` is the path separator.
- For HTTPS, prefer a full URL or object form when entering a custom port.
  APM may write the dependency to `apm.yml` as
  `host:PORT/owner/repo[#ref]`; the parser accepts this shorthand and
  normalizes `:443` to no port.
- A non-`git` SSH user is honored when present in the dep URL
  (e.g. `myuser@host:owner/repo.git` or `ssh://myuser@host/owner/repo.git`),
  useful for EMU accounts or servers where the SSH login is not `git`.
  Validated against `^[a-zA-Z0-9_][a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]*$` with a 64-char cap;
  percent-encoded userinfo is rejected. The user is presentation-only and
  not part of dependency identity (does not perturb lockfile dedup).
- The lockfile records `port: <int>` (1-65535) only when a non-default port
  is set. Manifest identity includes `host:port`, while the lockfile dedup
  key uses `host/repo`; the same repository reached through different
  ports maps to one lockfile key.

## Transport selection (SSH vs HTTPS)

Strict by default. Pick the transport up front; APM never silently retries
across protocols.

| Dependency form | Initial transport |
|-----------------|----------------|
| `ssh://...` or `git@host:...` | SSH |
| `https://...` or `http://...` | The explicit HTTP(S) scheme |
| Shorthand with `--ssh`, `APM_GIT_PROTOCOL=ssh`, or saved `prefer-ssh` | SSH |
| Shorthand otherwise | HTTPS |

A failed clone fails loudly, naming the URL and the protocol attempted.
An explicit scheme prevents APM from selecting another protocol unless
cross-protocol fallback is enabled. Git still applies a matching safe
`url.<base>.insteadOf` rule to the selected URL, which may choose the same host
over SSH or a local mirror.
For rewrite rejection and local-mirror recovery, see
[authentication](authentication.md).
This includes in-repository plugins from GitLab and generic git marketplaces:
an SSH registration is persisted as SSH `git:` and `path:`; an HTTPS
registration remains HTTPS.

Force the initial protocol for shorthand:

```bash
apm install owner/repo --ssh           # SSH for shorthand
apm install owner/repo --https         # HTTPS for shorthand
export APM_GIT_PROTOCOL=ssh            # session default
```

`--ssh` and `--https` are mutually exclusive and apply only to shorthand.
URLs with an explicit scheme ignore them.
Use `apm config set prefer-ssh true` to persist the shorthand preference.
Cross-protocol retry remains off unless `--allow-protocol-fallback`,
`APM_ALLOW_PROTOCOL_FALLBACK=1`, or
`apm config set allow-protocol-fallback true` enables it.
The selected protocol also governs remote tag enumeration when APM resolves a
Git-source semver range.

Match local `git clone` behavior by configuring `insteadOf` once:

```bash
git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"
apm install owner/repo                 # APM clones over SSH
```

Safe rewrites remain active. For rejection rules and recovery, see
[authentication](authentication.md).

Restore the legacy permissive chain (escape hatch -- not a long-term
setting):

```bash
apm install --allow-protocol-fallback
export APM_ALLOW_PROTOCOL_FALLBACK=1   # CI / migration window
```

When fallback runs, each cross-protocol retry emits a `[!]` warning naming
both protocols.

## Object form (complex cases)

Use the object form when the string shorthand cannot express what you need:
nested-group repos with virtual paths, custom SSH ports, local path deps,
aliases, or marketplace dependencies.

Three mutually exclusive keys select the form: `git`, `path`, or `marketplace`.

The legacy string suffix `@alias` is not supported; write `alias:` explicitly
instead so `@` remains reserved for git usernames and version syntax.

### Remote (`git`)

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `git` | REQUIRED | Clone URL (HTTPS, SSH, or FQDN shorthand). The literal `parent` inherits the consuming package's repo. |
| `path` | OPTIONAL | Subdirectory or file within the repo (virtual package). |
| `ref` | OPTIONAL | Branch, tag, or commit SHA. |
| `alias` | OPTIONAL | Install under a custom directory name (`^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$`). |
| `type` | OPTIONAL | Set to `gitlab` for self-managed GitLab on a bespoke hostname. Generic hosts do not receive APM-managed PATs on HTTP file reads. See the [lockfile spec](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/lockfile-spec/#lockfile-identity-keys) for keying rules. |
| `allow_insecure` | OPTIONAL | Manifest-side approval for an `http://` dependency; the install command still requires its separate insecure-host opt-in. |
| `skills` | OPTIONAL | Select deployed skills, not a repo slice; use `path` for a subdirectory. |
| `targets` | OPTIONAL | Consumer-side harness subset for that dependency's target-scoped primitives. Non-empty list of target names. |

Git [skill collections](../../../../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/package-types.md)
with `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` support `skills: [name]` without root `apm.yml` or `SKILL.md`.

Unknown fields are rejected. A Git `version` field reports an actionable error
to use `ref` for a branch, tag, or commit; `version` belongs to registry and
marketplace objects. The `git: parent` form accepts only `git`, `path`, `ref`,
and `alias`.

```yaml
- git: https://gitlab.com/acme/repo.git
  path: instructions/security                   # virtual sub-path
  ref: v2.0                                     # tag, branch, or SHA
  alias: acme-sec                               # local alias

- git: git@gitlab.com:group/subgroup/repo.git
  path: prompts/review.prompt.md

- git: ssh://git@bitbucket.example.com:7999/project/repo.git   # custom SSH port
  ref: v1.0

- git: https://code.acme.com/platform/standards.git               # bespoke GitLab
  type: gitlab
```

### Local (`path`)

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | REQUIRED | Filesystem path (must start with `./`, `../`, `/`, or `~/`). |
| `alias` | OPTIONAL | Install under a custom directory name (`^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$`). |
| `skills` | OPTIONAL | Consumer-side skill subset for that dependency. Non-empty list of skill names. |
| `targets` | OPTIONAL | Consumer-side harness subset for that dependency's target-scoped primitives. Non-empty list of target names. |

Local-path deps inside another local package resolve relative to that
package's directory, not the project root.

```yaml
- path: ./packages/my-skills

- path: ./packages/local-review-kit
  alias: local-review-kit
  skills: [reviewer]
  targets: [claude]
```

After install, `apm deps list` presents a local dependency as
`_local/<directory-name>`. For a direct declaration with matching
`apm.lock.yaml` metadata, that portable key is accepted verbatim by
`apm uninstall` and `apm uninstall -g`; user-scope automation does not need to
discover or print the absolute declared path. Without a lockfile, use the exact
manifest path. Remove transitive local dependencies through their declaring
parent.

If two declarations end in the same directory name, their portable keys are
ambiguous. Uninstall exits nonzero without running lifecycle scripts or writing
files. Use one exact path already present in the relevant `apm.yml`; APM never
guesses or removes both.

When three or more declarations share a slot, one exact-path uninstall must not
leave multiple physical survivors. Pass enough exact paths in the same command
that at most one declaration remains.

### Marketplace (`name` + `marketplace`)

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | REQUIRED | Plugin identifier within the marketplace (`^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$`). |
| `marketplace` | REQUIRED | Registered marketplace name (`^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$`). |
| `version` | OPTIONAL | Semver range or exact version (e.g. `~2.1.0`, `^2.0`, `>=1.4`, `2.1.0`). Resolved against git tags using the publisher's effective pattern: `packages[].tag_pattern`, then `marketplace.build.tagPattern`. Older metadata without `source.tag_pattern` uses the legacy `{name}--v{version}` fallback. |

During resolution, marketplace entries are looked up in the marketplace's
`marketplace.json` and replaced with concrete git coordinates. When `version`
is a semver range or bare version number, the resolver lists git tags
using the `source.tag_pattern` emitted by `apm pack`. The package-level
`tag_pattern` overrides `marketplace.build.tagPattern`. APM filters by the
constraint and picks the highest matching tag. Old `marketplace.json` files
that omit `source.tag_pattern` fall back to `{name}--v{version}`. Patterns
must contain exactly one `{version}` placeholder, and a no-match does not
silently become a raw ref. Raw git refs (e.g. `v2.0.0`, `main`) bypass tag
resolution. The lockfile records the resolved ref, not the marketplace
placeholder. Unknown keys in a marketplace entry are rejected.

Producer-emitted `source: url` and `source: git-subdir` objects resolve
through the same Git dependency parser as direct object-form dependencies.
The package URL owns the host; `git-subdir.path` owns the contained package
path. Both survive into the concrete `git:`, `path:`, and `ref:` manifest
entry and the lockfile. Invalid URLs or unsafe paths fail before durable
project writes.

Catalog-only entries with inline `lspServers` or `mcpServers` remain valid
marketplace dependencies when downloaded source has no package manifest. Keep
the consumer declaration in the object form above; catalog server fields do not
belong in `dependencies.apm`. APM ignores unrelated catalog dependency fields
and rejects the package if any declared server is invalid. See
[Catalog-only marketplace packages](../../../../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/package-types.md#catalog-only-marketplace-package).

If the marketplace plugin entry declares `registry`, APM creates a
registry-sourced dependency instead of Git coordinates. Enable registry support
with `apm experimental enable registries` and configure the named registry.
The entry must also declare a valid semver `version`; malformed or unresolvable
registry intent fails closed and never falls back to Git.

```yaml
- name: sec-check
  marketplace: acme-plugins

- name: secrets-vault
  marketplace: acme-plugins
  version: "~2.1.0"
```

## Registry-sourced APM dependencies (experimental)

Behind `apm experimental enable registries`. Registry deps resolve over the
REST [Registry HTTP API](../../../../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/registry-http-api.md)
alongside the Git resolver -- declare registries in `apm.yml` (or in
`~/.apm/config.json`) and reference them from `dependencies.apm`. See
`authentication.md` (Registry tokens) for the required user-owned URL
binding and `APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_{NAME}`.

```yaml
registries:
  jf-skills:
    url: https://registry.example.com/apm/jf-skills
  default: jf-skills                       # optional; routes shorthand deps

dependencies:
  apm:
    # String shorthand -- requires a default registry; always needs a semver ref
    - acme/foo#^1.2.3                      # semver range -> default registry
    - acme/bar#1.4.0                       # exact semver -> default registry

    # Object form -- whole package via the default registry
    - id: acme/toolkit
      version: ^2.0.0

    # Object form -- explicit registry by name
    - registry: jf-skills
      id: acme/toolkit
      version: ^2.0.0

    # Object form -- virtual package (sub-path inside a published package)
    - registry: jf-skills
      id: acme/prompt-pack
      path: prompts/review.prompt.md
      version: 1.4.0
      alias: review-prompt                 # optional local alias
```

Object-form fields:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `id` | yes | `owner/repo` identity at the registry |
| `version` | yes | Exact semver version or semver range (e.g. `1.4.0`, `^2.0.0`, `>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`). Non-semver refs (labels like `stable`/`latest`, `v`-prefixed tags, branch names, SHAs) are rejected when routed to a registry |
| `registry` | no | Name from the merged registry map; defaults to the effective default |
| `path` | no | Sub-path to a file or directory within the published package |
| `alias` | no | Local alias controlling the install directory name |

Routing rules when a default registry is active:

| Entry form | Routed to |
|------------|-----------|
| `owner/repo#<any-ref>` | Default registry |
| `- id:` object (no `registry:`) | Default registry |
| `- registry:` object | Named registry |
| `- git:` object | Git (explicit override) |
| `- path:` object | Local filesystem |

A shorthand entry with no ref (`acme/foo`) is **rejected** when routed to a
registry -- a semver version selector is always required. Non-semver refs
(labels, `v`-prefixed tags, branch names) are also rejected for registry
sources; use `- git:` to keep a dep on Git when a default registry is
active. Registry-routed deps add `source: registry`, `version`,
`resolved_url`, and `resolved_hash` (sha256 of the archive bytes) to
their lockfile entry, and the lockfile is promoted to
`lockfile_version: "2"` when any dep is registry-sourced OR carries
git-source semver resolution fields (`constraint` / `resolved_at`) or a
revision-pin tag annotation (`resolved_tag`).

The `acme/foo@registry-name#version` shorthand is **not supported** (deferred
to v2) -- the `@` collides with npm/cargo/pip version syntax, with
`git@host`, and with marketplace plugin shorthand. Use the object form.

## Virtual package types

Virtual packages reference a subset of a repository.

| Type | Detection rule | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| File | Ends in `.prompt.md`, `.instructions.md`, or `.agent.md` | `owner/repo/prompts/review.prompt.md` |
| Subdirectory | Does not match a file extension above | `owner/repo/skills/security` |

Classification is by extension only. A path like `owner/repo/collections/security` (no extension) is a Subdirectory; the actual shape -- APM package (incl. dep-only `apm.yml` with no `.apm/`), skill bundle, or plugin -- is resolved at fetch time by probing for `apm.yml`.

**Gitea and Gogs (self-hosted or vendor-hosted):** virtual packages resolve via the host's `/{owner}/{repo}/raw/{ref}/{path}` URL first, then fall back to the Contents API (v1 native, v3 Gogs-compat). Direct GitLab nested-group repos (`group/subgroup/repo`) require the object form (`git: <full-url>`, `path: <virtual>`) -- shorthand is ambiguous on >2-segment paths. **Exception:** when the dep routes through a registry proxy (explicit `host/artifactory/<key>/...` FQDN, or bare shorthand under `PROXY_REGISTRY_URL` + `PROXY_REGISTRY_ONLY=1`), the install-time boundary probe HEAD-walks the candidate splits against the proxy and locks in the first one whose archive responds, so nested-group shorthand works without the object form (#1472).

> **Removed (#1094):** the legacy `.collection.yml` / `.collection.yaml` virtual-package form is no longer supported. Convert any `.collection.yml` to an `apm.yml` with a `dependencies:` section, then reference the resulting subdirectory as a regular subdirectory virtual package.

## Canonical storage rules

APM normalizes dependency strings when saving to apm.yml:

| Input | Stored as |
|-------|-----------|
| `microsoft/apm-sample-package` | `microsoft/apm-sample-package` |
| `https://github.com/microsoft/apm-sample-package.git` | `microsoft/apm-sample-package` |
| `git@github.com:microsoft/apm-sample-package.git` | `microsoft/apm-sample-package` |
| `https://gitlab.com/acme/rules.git` | `gitlab.com/acme/rules` |
| Object with `git` + `path: docs` + `ref: main` | `org/repo/docs#main` |
| `./packages/my-skills` | `./packages/my-skills` |

GitHub URLs are stripped to shorthand; non-GitHub hosts keep the FQDN.

## Per-dependency target selection (`targets:`)

`targets:` is an optional per-dependency list on the object form of a
`dependencies.apm` entry. It restricts which active install targets
receive that dependency's target-scoped primitives.

Package-level `targets:` (top-level) selects the package's own
compile/install targets; per-dependency `targets:` (inside a
`dependencies.apm` entry) selects which active targets receive that
dependency's target-scoped primitives. They compose via intersection. See
`package-authoring.md` for author guidance.

- Type: list of target keys. Stable targets are `copilot`, `claude`, `grok-build`,
  `cursor`, `codex`, `gemini`, `antigravity`, `windsurf`, `kiro`,
  `opencode`, `agent-skills`, and `hermes`. Experimental targets are `openclaw`,
  `copilot-cowork`, `copilot-app`, and `grok-cloud`. Use `copilot`, not the
  target alias `vscode`, for Copilot-family dependency routing.
- Default: omitted means all active install targets.
- Semantics: effective reach is `install_targets INTERSECT dep_targets`.
  A non-empty list narrows reach; it never widens beyond what the install
  resolved. An empty list is a parse error; remove the field to mean
  "all".
- Supported on: both `git:` and `path:` dependency forms.

```yaml
dependencies:
  apm:
    - git: owner/codex-hooks
      targets: [codex]

    - git: owner/universal-hooks
      # no targets: all active install targets

    - path: ./skills/my-local-skill
      targets: [claude]         # local deps support targets: too
```

The lockfile records `target_subset` for audit/display only. Install
routing always recomputes from the live `apm.yml` entry, so editing the
lockfile cannot widen a dependency's reach. The formal schema contract
lives in `docs/src/content/docs/reference/manifest-schema.md` section
4.1.2.

## MCP dependency formats

See also: [MCP Servers guide](../../../../../docs/src/content/docs/consumer/install-mcp-servers.md) for the CLI-first `apm install --mcp` workflow.

```yaml
dependencies:
  mcp:
    # Registry reference (string)
    - io.github.github/github-mcp-server

    # Registry with overlays (object)
    - name: io.github.github/github-mcp-server
      transport: stdio                          # stdio|sse|http|streamable-http (MCP transport names, not URL schemes; remote connects over HTTPS)
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      args: ["--port", "3000"]
      version: "1.5.0"
      package: npm                              # npm|pypi|oci
      headers:
        X-Custom: "value"
        # Env-var placeholders in headers/env values:
        #   ${VAR} or ${env:VAR}  -> Copilot CLI: preserved as ${VAR} and resolved
        #                            from host env at server-start (no plaintext on disk).
        #                            VS Code and JetBrains: rewritten to ${env:VAR}
        #                            and resolved at runtime.
        #                            Kiro: preserved as ${VAR} and resolved at runtime.
        #                            Cursor/Windsurf/OpenCode/Claude/Gemini: resolved at install time.
        #                            Codex: resolved at install time.
        #   ${input:<id>}         -> VS Code prompts user at runtime
        #   <VAR>                 -> deprecated; auto-translated, emits a warning
        # Registry-declared optional env/input fields are omitted when unset;
        # see manifest-schema section 4.2.4 for reinstall preservation semantics.
        Authorization: "Bearer ${MY_TOKEN}"
      tools: ["repos", "issues"]

    # Self-defined server (not in registry)
    - name: my-private-server
      registry: false
      transport: stdio
      command: ./bin/my-server
      args: ["--port", "3000"]
      env:
        API_KEY: ${{ secrets.KEY }}

    # Self-defined HTTP server
    - name: internal-kb
      registry: false
      transport: http
      url: "https://mcp.internal.example.com"

    # Self-defined remote with harness-specific extra keys
    # Unknown keys (e.g. oauth) are passthrough: preserved and written into
    # the generated config for EVERY installed harness. Keys that collide with
    # a modeled or adapter-owned field
    # (command/url/headers/env/enabled/environment/http_headers/id/...) are rejected.
    - name: slack
      registry: false
      transport: http
      url: https://mcp.slack.com/mcp

        clientId: "<pre-registered-client-id>"
        callbackPort: 3118
```

MCP Registry v0.1 uses `registryType: oci` for container packages. APM
maps that type to the Docker launcher automatically, preserves Docker
run options before the image, and appends package arguments after the
image. Copilot, Codex, Gemini, and related adapters select `npm`, OCI,
then PyPI; VS Code selects `npm`, PyPI, then OCI. Docker must be
available when the harness starts an OCI server. Do not add per-target
launcher overrides.

For VS Code and Copilot-family adapters, non-container `npm`, `pypi`,
and generic packages preserve typed v0.1 `runtimeArguments` and
`packageArguments` in authored order, with exactly one semantic package
identity. Legacy `value_hint` arguments remain compatible. Registry
defaults resolve normally, secret variables use target-native references,
unresolved optional groups are omitted atomically, and malformed or
unresolved required entries fail closed.

### Development MCP scope

Use `dependencies.mcp` for servers that a consuming project should
receive. Use `devDependencies.mcp` for author-only servers such as local
mocks or debug bridges:

```yaml
devDependencies:
  mcp:
    - name: author-debug
      registry: false
      transport: stdio
      command: ./scripts/author-debug
```

The root project activates both sections during `apm install`. Direct
and transitive dependency packages contribute only `dependencies.mcp`;
their development MCP entries do not enter the consumer's target config
or `mcp_config_provenance`.

At user scope, Claude MCP entries are written to
`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.claude.json` when `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set to a
non-whitespace absolute path. Unset or blank values use `~/.claude.json`;
relative values are rejected.

## LSP dependency formats

LSP (Language Server Protocol) servers give supported runtimes real-time
code intelligence. APM currently writes LSP config for Claude Code and
GitHub Copilot CLI while keeping the dependency schema runtime-neutral.

```yaml
dependencies:
  lsp:
    # String reference (name only)
    - gopls

    # Full object
    - name: pyright
      command: pyright-langserver
      args: ["--stdio"]
      extensionToLanguage:
        ".py": python
        ".pyi": python

`apm install` writes LSP config to the detected runtime targets. Claude Code
project installs use the `lspServers` section in
`.claude/skills/apm-lsp/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`; global installs use
`~/.claude/skills/apm-lsp/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. GitHub Copilot CLI uses
`.github/lsp.json` or `~/.copilot/lsp-config.json`. Copilot CLI uses
`fileExtensions` on disk;
manifests continue to use `extensionToLanguage`. A dependency package's source
`.lsp.json` may use either a flat server map or a
`{ "lspServers": { ... } }` envelope; it is distinct from the Claude project
plugin manifest that APM generates. Dependency-provided LSP commands require
executable approval for the declaring package when a project or org
`executables` block enables the gate; the compatibility default permits them
when no layer opts in. For Copilot-dialect plugin input, APM accepts
`fileExtensions` as an alias for `extensionToLanguage` and `warmupTimeoutMs` as
an alias for `startupTimeout`; a non-null canonical value wins when both are
supplied, while a null canonical value falls back to its alias. APM ignores the
unsupported Copilot `cwd` field and warns that the consumer runtime chooses the
working directory. Copilot output uses `fileExtensions` and `warmupTimeoutMs`;
manifests and lockfiles retain `extensionToLanguage` and `startupTimeout`. APM
records target-scoped LSP ownership in the lockfile so target changes and
package uninstall revoke only entries it wrote.

## Version pinning

| Strategy | Syntax | When to use |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Tag | `owner/repo#v1.0.0` | Production -- immutable reference |
| Semver range | `owner/repo#^1.2.0` | Track patch/minor updates within a range; APM lists remote tags and pins the highest match in the lockfile |
| Branch | `owner/repo#main` | Development -- tracks latest |
| Commit SHA | `owner/repo#abc123d` | Maximum reproducibility; `apm update` can move full 40-character SHA pins to the latest annotated semver tag SHA and annotate the line with `# <tag>` |
| No ref | `owner/repo` | Resolves default branch at install time |
| Marketplace ref | `plugin@marketplace#ref` | Override marketplace source ref |

Semver ranges accept `^1.2.0`, `~1.4`, `>=2.0 <3`, or `1.5.x`. At
install time APM runs `git ls-remote` against the dep and picks the
highest tag matching the range; the resolved tag, commit SHA, version,
and original constraint are pinned in the lockfile. Subsequent
`apm install` runs replay the lockfile without network. Use
`apm update` (or change the manifest constraint) to re-resolve against
current remote tags. Update-like commands require authenticated upstream
truth and do not accept a stale persistent bare-cache ref. Tag patterns are tried in order:
`v{version}`, `{name}--v{version}`, and `{name}-v{version}`, then a bare
`{version}` fallback. For virtual subdirectory deps, `{name}` is the
final path segment (for example `pkg-a` in `acme/mono/packages/pkg-a`). A
malformed range-like ref is rejected; use a plain range such as `^1.2.0`
or pin a literal tag such as `pkg-a-v1.2.0`.

## Marketplace ref override

When installing from a marketplace, the `#` suffix overrides the `source.ref` from the marketplace entry:

| Syntax | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `plugin@mkt` | Use marketplace source ref | `plugin@mkt` |
| `plugin@mkt#v2.0.0` | Override with specific tag | `plugin@mkt#v2.0.0` |
| `plugin@mkt#main` | Override with branch | `plugin@mkt#main` |
| `plugin@mkt#abc123d` | Override with commit SHA | `plugin@mkt#abc123d` |

## HTTP dependencies (opt-in)

HTTP is never attempted implicitly. A dep fetched over `http://` requires
dual opt-in on every install:

1. **Manifest approval** -- the apm.yml entry carries `allow_insecure: true`.
2. **Invocation approval** -- `apm install --allow-insecure` for direct
   deps, or `--allow-insecure-host HOSTNAME` (repeatable) for transitive
   deps. Transitive HTTP deps from hosts not listed are blocked.

Example apm.yml entry:

```yaml
dependencies:
  apm:
    - git: http://mirror.example.com/acme/rules.git
      ref: v1.2.0
      allow_insecure: true
```

Example invocation:

```bash
apm install --allow-insecure --allow-insecure-host mirror.example.com
```

Mental model: HTTP is opt-in per-dep AND per-invocation. Removing either
side re-locks the dependency. The lockfile records `is_insecure: true` and
`allow_insecure: true` on the entry so replays fail-closed when either
approval is dropped. See `commands.md` for full flag syntax and the
enterprise security guide for the threat model.

## What the lockfile pins

`apm.lock.yaml` records the exact commit SHA for every dependency, regardless
of the ref format in apm.yml. Running `apm install` without `--update` always
uses the locked SHA, ensuring reproducible installs across machines.
`apm install --update`, `apm install --refresh`, `apm update` (including
`--force`), `apm lock --update`, and `apm outdated` establish mutable refs from
upstream instead of using a persistent bare-cache ref as current-state evidence.

Lockfile keys keep `github.com` implicit for migration stability while
non-default hosts add the lowercased host segment. See the [lockfile spec](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/reference/lockfile-spec/#lockfile-identity-keys)
for the full keying rules.

Each dependency entry can also record the package-declared `name`. For
git/local deps, `version` is read from the dependency's own `apm.yml` at
resolution time. These package-declared values are **SELF-ASSERTED** author
claims useful for inventory and audit -- they are NOT integrity-verified and
MUST NOT be used for trust decisions. Always cross-reference `repo_url` +
`resolved_commit` (or `resolved_hash`) for provenance. For registry deps,
`version` is the locked registry selection used for reinstall, with
`resolved_hash` as the integrity anchor; for git/local deps it is display
metadata only.
