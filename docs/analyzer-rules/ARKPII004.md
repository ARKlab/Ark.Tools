# ARKPII004: Classified data reaches telemetry

- **Severity:** Info
- **Component:** Compliance
- **Diagnostic message:** `an Activity tag, metric dimension, or baggage`

## What it checks

This Ark.Tools diagnostic identifies the condition described above and reports it at the relevant declaration, contract, or generated-code input. The diagnostic message includes the contextual symbol and the required correction where applicable.

## How to fix it

Apply the correction stated by the diagnostic. Do not suppress the rule when changing the declaration, contract, host configuration, or data flow is possible.

### Incorrect

```csharp
// Violates the rule
logger.LogInformation("{Value}", classifiedValue);
```

### Correct

```csharp
// Use the approved classification, purpose, policy, or redactor described by the diagnostic.
logger.LogInformation("Value available");
```

## Suppression and configuration

Use the standard `dotnet_diagnostic.ARKPII004.severity` EditorConfig setting only for an intentional exception. Prefer a documented, reviewed suppression over disabling the rule globally.
