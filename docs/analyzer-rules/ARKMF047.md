## What it checks

This Ark.Tools diagnostic identifies the condition described above and reports it at the relevant declaration, contract, or generated-code input. The diagnostic message includes the contextual symbol and the required correction where applicable.

## How to fix it

Apply the correction stated by the diagnostic. Do not suppress the rule when changing the declaration, contract, host configuration, or data flow is possible.

### Incorrect

```csharp
// Violates the rule
// Generated contract or host declaration does not satisfy the diagnostic.
```

### Correct
