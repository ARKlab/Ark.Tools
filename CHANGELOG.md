All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `ArkAdaptiveSampler` has a constructor that accepts a `TimeProvider`, so tests can control sampling time.
- `ArkGenerateComplianceSqlStandalone` returns the generated `policy-*.compliance.sql` files, so database projects can collect them without passing global properties. See the updated database project example in the SQL policies guide.

### Changed

- Lower per-call overhead on hot paths: root-span sampling in `ArkAdaptiveSampler`, SQL span filtering and query labels, ResourceWatcher activity tags, polymorphic JSON reads, `ToObject<T>` on `JsonElement` and `JsonDocument`, polymorphic `DataTable` shredding, the MVC ETag filter, Minimal API ETag and MessagePack negotiation, Storage Queue header decoding, gRPC business-rule errors, and authorization logging when Trace is off.
- The compliance analyzers do less work per operation, which shortens builds of projects that enable them.

### Fixed

- `ArkAdaptiveSampler` measures elapsed time with a monotonic clock, so system clock changes no longer distort trace rate limiting.
