# EditorConfig Organization

This directory contains the reorganized .editorconfig files for the Ark.Tools repository.

## File Structure

The .editorconfig has been split into the following files for better organization:

### 1. `.editorconfig` (Main file)
The main .editorconfig file that combines all the settings. This is the file that will be used by editors and build tools.

### 2. `.editorconfig-style.ini` (Style and Formatting)
Contains:
- Core EditorConfig options (indentation, spacing, line endings)
- .NET coding conventions (dotnet_* rules)
- C# coding conventions (csharp_* rules)
- C# formatting rules
- Naming styles
- Code quality configuration

### 3. `.editorconfig-netanalyzers.ini` (Microsoft Code Analyzers)
Contains:
- CA* rules (Microsoft .NET Code Analysis rules)
- IDE* rules (Visual Studio IDE code style rules)
- All rules are sorted by rule number
- Each rule includes a comment with its official description

### 4. `.editorconfig-meziantou.ini` (Third-party Analyzers)
Contains:
- MA* rules (Meziantou.Analyzer rules)
- VSTHRD* rules (Visual Studio Threading Analyzers)
- All rules are sorted by rule number
- Each rule includes a comment with its official description

## How to Use

The main `.editorconfig` file is automatically used by:
- Visual Studio
- Visual Studio Code (with EditorConfig extension)
- JetBrains Rider
- Command-line builds (dotnet build)

The separate `.ini` files are for documentation and reference purposes. Since EditorConfig doesn't support file includes, the main `.editorconfig` file contains all the content from the separate files combined.

## Maintenance

When updating rules:

1. **For style/formatting changes**: Edit `.editorconfig-style.ini` and update the corresponding section in `.editorconfig`
2. **For CA*/IDE* rules**: Edit `.editorconfig-netanalyzers.ini` and update the corresponding section in `.editorconfig`
3. **For MA*/VSTHRD* rules**: Edit `.editorconfig-meziantou.ini` and update the corresponding section in `.editorconfig`

Remember to keep the main `.editorconfig` file in sync with the individual `.ini` files.

## Rule Documentation

Each diagnostic rule includes a comment with its official description from:
- **CA* rules**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/
- **IDE* rules**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/
- **MA* rules**: https://github.com/meziantou/Meziantou.Analyzer
- **VSTHRD* rules**: https://github.com/microsoft/vs-threading

## Changes from Original

The reorganization:
- ✅ Kept all existing rules and their severity levels unchanged
- ✅ Added official descriptions for all diagnostic rules
- ✅ Sorted all diagnostic rules by their code number
- ✅ Grouped rules by category (style, netanalyzers, meziantou)
- ✅ Maintained all core style settings, naming conventions, and formatting rules
