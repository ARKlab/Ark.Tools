# This is a local override file for analyzer diagnostics specific to this project.
# According to Microsoft documentation, .globalconfig files have higher priority than
# other global analyzer config files (.netanalyzers.globalconfig, .meziantou.globalconfig).
# This file is automatically discovered and imported by MSBuild - no need to reference it
# in Directory.Build.props.
#
# Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/configuration-files
#
# Use this file to:
# - Override severity levels for specific rules in this project
# - Disable rules that don't apply to this sample project
# - Add project-specific analyzer configurations
#
# Example: To test that .globalconfig has precedence, uncomment the line below
# (CA1000 is set to "none" in .netanalyzers.globalconfig, this would override it to "warning")
# dotnet_diagnostic.CA1000.severity = warning

is_global = true

# Add your project-specific analyzer overrides below this line
