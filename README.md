# Ark.Tools

This is a set of core libraries developed and maintained by Ark as a set of helper or extensions of the libraries Ark choose to use in their LOB applications.

## Getting Started

All libraries are provided in NuGet.

Support for .NET Standard 2.1, .NET 8.0 LTS.

## Quick Start

The main library used by Ark in its stack are

* [NodaTime](https://nodatime.org/)
* [SimpleInjector](https://simpleinjector.org/)
* [Polly](http://www.thepollyproject.org/)
* [Dapper](http://dapper-tutorial.net/)
* [AspNetCore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/)

If you want to learn more about each project, look the respective Readme when present or directly at code.
Documentation improvements are up-for-grabs ;)

## Migrate from Specflow to Reqnroll (v5.1)

**Support for Speflow is no longer mainteined and will be removed in next Major.**

The ReferenceProject has been migrated from Specflow to Reqnroll. For reasons you can read [this](https://reqnroll.net/news/2024/02/from-specflow-to-reqnroll-why-and-how/) but long story short: Specflow is no longer mainteined.

`Ark.Tools.Reqnroll` replaces `Ark.Tools.Specflow`: the only changes are in `namespace`.

To migrate:
1. Replace `Techtalk.Specflow` to `Reqnroll` in `using`
1. Replace `Ark.Tools.Specflow` to `Ark.Tools.Reqnroll` in both `using` and `PackageReference`
1. Replace `Specflow.*` to `Reqnroll.*` in `PackageReference`
1. Add [`reqnroll.json`](./ArkReferenceProject/Core/Tests/reqnroll.json) to test projects
1. Fix Verbs: Reqnroll default to Gherking style parameters instead of Regex style thus it might be required to update verbs as described [here](https://docs.reqnroll.net/latest/guides/migrating-from-specflow.html#cucumber-expressions-support-compatibility-of-existing-expressions), specifying the regex start/end markers (^/$).

## Ark.Tools v5 Breaking Changes

### .NET 8.0

.NET SDK has been updated to .NET 8. AspNetCore packages only target .NET8 (latest LTS).

### Deprecated .NET Framework, NetStandard

.NET8 is the minimum version going forward.

### Flurl v4 Migration Guide

In services that use `IFlurlClient`, the `IFlurlClientFactory` will be replaced with the new `IArkFlurlClientFactory`. The difference in services is that now the flurl clients must be manually disposed after use by implementing IDisposable. An example implementation can be found in the WebApplicationDemo in the `PostService`.

*Note: To continue using Newtonsoft as the json serializer, there is a param `useNewtonsoftJson` in the `IArkFlurlClientFactory.Get()` method.

In the TestHost for initializing tests that use Flurl, we now use `ArkFlurlClientFactory` as the factory. To connect to the test server we extend the `DefaultFlurlClientFactory` as such:

```class TestServerfactory : DefaultFlurlClientFactory
{
    private readonly TestServer _server;

    public TestServerfactory(TestServer server)
    {
        _server = server;
    }

    public override HttpMessageHandler CreateInnerHandler()
    {
        return _server.CreateHandler();
    }
}
```

We then initialize the factory:

`_factory = new ArkFlurlClientFactory(new TestServerfactory(_server.GetTestServer()));`

We then register the factor as usual:

`ctx.ScenarioContainer.RegisterFactoryAs<IFlurlClient>(c => _factory.Get(_baseUri));`

An example can be found in the TestProject under `TestHost`.

### Rebus upgrade to v8

Rebus has been upgraded to v8. 

1. There is a Breaking Change on SecondLevelRetries where `IFailed<T>` no longer has the `Exception` object, but a serialization friendly `ExceptionInfo`. Use `exceptionInfo.ToException()` to obtain an exception: do note that the original `StackTrace` is in the `Exception.Message` and not in the `Exception.StackTrace`.
2. The `UseAzureServiceBusNativeDeliveryCount()` is deprecated in favor of native support by Rebus. Migrate to `UseAzureServiceBus(...).UseNativeMessageDeliveryCount()`.

## Upgrade Ark.Tools v4.5

In v4.5 has been revisited the NLog integration and helpers to make use of new features present in NLog v5.

### NLog 'default' Configuration

The best way to configure NLog is

```cs
    Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
        .ConfigureNLog()
        .ConfigureServices(...)
    ;
```

is equivalent to

```cs
    .ConfigureLogging((ctx,l) =>
    {
        var appName = Assembly.GetEntryAssembly().GetName().Name;
        NLogConfigurer
            .For(appName)
            // Load default settings from IConfiguration
            .WithDefaultTargetsAndRulesFromConfiguration(ctx.Configuration)
            .Apply();

        l.ClearProviders(); // remove all Microsoft providers
        l.AddNLog(); // sink all Microsoft.Logging logs to NLog
    })
```

`.WithDefaultTargetsAndRulesFromAppSettings()` and `.WithDefaultTargetsAndRulesFromCloudSettings()` exists for older Configuration sources.

The NLog auto-configurer expect the following settings:

* `NLog.Database` for SQL Server target. The table name is passed in as paramter to the configuration extension method.
* `NLog.Smtp` for the Mail target
  * `NLog:NotificationList` for the receipient address.
  * **NEW** The sender address is taken from Smtp connection string `;From=noreply@example.com` or from `.ConfigureNLog(mailfrom:"me@myapp.com")` (defaults to `noreply@ark-energy.eu`)
* `NLog:SlackWebHook` for the Slack target. By default only `Fatal` and `LoggerName=Slack.*` are sent.
* `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` or `ApplicationInsights:InstrumentationKey` for the ApplicationInsights target. By default only `>=Error` are sent.

### NLog Structured Logging

Logging represent a non trivial part of the CPU consumption of a running Assembly: strings are bad, concateneting them is costly.
Log Messages are also generally structured to present some context variables which are of interest.

`NLog@v4.5` introduced [StructuredLogging](https://github.com/NLog/NLog/wiki/How-to-use-structured-logging) template support.
`Ark.Tools@v4.5` (same version, just a coincidence...) supports writing these captured properties in ApplicationInsights and Database Targets.

StructuredLogging is also more performant of string interpolation: string interpolation (`$"Message {variable}"`) **SHALL NOT be used for Logging!**
String interpolation is always performed even usually disabled levels like `Trace` or `Debug` causing a performance loss.
Additionally the variables are not captured and cannot be used for log analysis querying the JSON fields.

```cs
// BAD
_logger.Info($"Logon by {user} from {ip_address}");

// GOOD
_logger.Info(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, "Logon by {user} from {ip_address}", user, ip_address); // ordered by position
```

### NLog Slack (>=v4.4)

Starting `Ark.Tools@v4.4` there is support for Logging to Slack via [WebHook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

The Configuration auto-loaders like `WithDefaultTargetsAndRulesFromConfiguration()` looks for a `NLog:SlackWebHook` and if non-empty configure to send Logs as chat message to Slack.
The default Rules are either:

* LoggerName="Slack.*" (created via `_slackLogger = LogManager.CreateLogger("Slack.MyStuff");`)
* Level==Fatal

### NLog ApplicationInsights

Starting `Ark.Tools@v4.5` there is support for Logging to ApplicationInsights.

The Configuration auto-loaders like `WithDefaultTargetsAndRulesFromConfiguration()` looks for the Microsoft's default settings like `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` and `ApplicationInsights:InstrumentationKey`.

The default Rules to log any `Error` or `Fatal` to ApplicationInsights, including any `Exception` and StructuredLogging properties.

## Migrate from v2 to v3

* **BREAKING:** Microsoft.AspNetCore v5
  * change netcoreapp3.1 to net5.0 on all projects referencing Ark.Tools.AspNetCore.* projects
* **BREAKING:** from `System.Data.SqlClient` to `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`
  * remove any Nuget reference to `System.Data.SqlClient` and replace, where needed, with `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`
* **BREAKING:** upgraded to Flurl v3
  * most usages should be fine, but those that expected Flurl method to return a HttpMessageResponse, as not returns IFlurlResponse **Disposable!**
* **BREAKING:** change to AspNetCore base Startup on RegisterContainer()
  * RegisterContainer() no longer takes IApplicationBuilder parameter but a IServiceProvider as the Container registration has been moved during ConfigureServices()
  * this affects mostly those cases where IServiceProvider was used to check for Tests overrides of mocked services
  * Use IHostEnvironment or services.HasService if possible instead of relying on IServiceProvider
* **BREAKING:** change to AspNetCore Startups. Now defaults to System.Text.Json instead of Newtonsoft.Json.
  * Use the parameter `useNewtonsoftJson: true` of base ctor to keep old behaviour
  * Migrate from the `Ark.Tools.SystemTextJson.JsonPolymorphicConverter` instead of `Ark.Tools.NewtonsoftJson.JsonPolymorphicConverter`
